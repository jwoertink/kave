# Kave (Kemal API Version Extension) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/jwoertink/kave.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/jwoertink/kave)

This shards makes it easier to version your [Kemal](http://kemalcr.com/) API

## Installation

Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  kave:
    github: jwoertink/kave
```


## Usage

```crystal
require "kemal"
require "kave"

Kave.configure do |c|
  # These are default config options
  # c.format = :json                # see Formats below
  # c.auth_strategy = nil           # see Auth Strategy below
  # c.token_model = Kave::AuthToken # see Auth Strategy below
  # c.version_strategy = :header    # see Version Strategy below
end

public do
  get "/" do |env|
    "This is a public route"
  end
end

api("v1") do
  get "/" do |env|
    "This is a private route only accessed through the version 1 API"
  end

  before_post "/check" do |env|
    "This is called before POST /v1/check"
  end
  post "/check" do |env|
    "something here"
  end
end

api("v2") do
  get "/" do |env|
    "This is a private route only accessed through the version 2 API"
  end
end
```

## Configuration Options

### Formats
The formats are how your data will be returned. By default, Kave will assume you're building a JSON API.
Kave will automatically set your response `Content-Type` to match the type of API you're building. 

For now, you must handle the data conversion yourself, but eventually Kave will take care of that for you. 

```crystal
# assumes format is :json
api("v1") do
  get "/users/:id" do |env|
    {"id" => env.params.url["id"], "name" => "jeremy"}.to_json
  end
end
```

You would make a call to this route by `http://localhost:3000/v1/users/1`

Additional options later will be `:xml`, `:msgpack`, `:plain`

### Auth Strategy
If your API isn't public, then you'll probably want to add some sort of API key. By default, Kave sets the `auth_strategy` to nil, but you can use a Bearer token authorization. To use this, set the `auth_strategy` to `:bearer`, and create a class that inherits from `Kave::AuthToken`. Set the `token_model` to your custom class, and make sure that class implements the class method `locate`.

```crystal
class MyTokenModel < Kave::AuthToken
  def self.locate(token : String)
    token == "abc123"
  end
end

Kave.configure do |c|
  c.auth_strategy = :bearer
  c.token_model = MyTokenModel
end

api("v1") do
  get "/users/:id" do |env|
    {"id" => env.params.url["id"], "name" => "jeremy"}.to_json
  end
end
```

To access this route:
```text
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer abc123" "http://localhost:3000/v1/users/1"
```

### Version Strategy

By default, Kave will generate paths for your API by prepending the version to your route like `/v1/whatever`. This option gives you the ability to specify your routes like `/whatever` and control the version using a header. Later there may be an option like `:subdomain` to do `v1.whatever.com/whatever`.

```crystal
Kave.configure do |c|
  c.version_strategy = :header
end

api("v1") do
  get "/users" do |env|
    [{"id" => 1, "name" => "Jeremy"}].to_json
  end
end
```

To access this route:
```text
$ curl -H "Accept: application/vnd.api.v1+json" "http://localhost:3000/users"
```

**NOTE** In a previous version of Kave you were able to change this halfway through. I realized after lots of trail and error that this was going to cause a huge mess. You can't conditionally add middleware. It's either there, or it's not. I may add that back in later if I can come up with some clever way, but until people start asking for that, it's out for now.
